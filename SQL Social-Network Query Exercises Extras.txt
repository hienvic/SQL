1.For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.
SELECT hs1.name, hs1.grade, hs2.name, hs2.grade, hs3.name, hs3.grade
FROM Highschooler hs1, Highschooler hs2, Highschooler hs3, Likes l1, Likes l2
WHERE hs1.ID = l1.ID1 AND hs2.ID = l1.ID2 AND (hs2.ID = l2.ID1 AND hs3.ID = l2.ID2 AND hs3.ID <> hs1.ID)

2.Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.
SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler hs1
WHERE grade NOT IN(
	SELECT hs2.grade
	FROM Highschooler hs2, Friend fr
	WHERE hs1.ID = fr.ID1 AND hs2.ID = fr.ID2
);

3.What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)
SELECT AVG(count)
FROM (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM Friend
  GROUP BY ID1
);

4.Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Friend
WHERE ID1 IN 
(
	SELECT ID2
	FROM Friend
	WHERE ID1 IN 
		(
			SELECT ID
			FROM Highschooler
			WHERE name = 'Cassandra'
		)
);

5.Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.
SELECT name, grade 
FROM Highschooler hs
INNER JOIN Friend ON hs.ID = Friend.ID1
GROUP BY ID1
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
  SELECT MAX(count)
  FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM Friend
    GROUP BY ID1
  )
);
