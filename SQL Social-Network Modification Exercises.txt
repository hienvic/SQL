1.It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler.
DELETE FROM Highschooler
WHERE grade = 12

2.If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple.
DELETE FROM Likes
WHERE ID1 IN 
(
	SELECT Likes.ID1
	FROM Friend
	INNER JOIN Likes USING(ID1)
	WHERE Likes.ID2 = Friend.ID2
) AND ID2 NOT IN
(
	SELECT Likes.ID1
	FROM Friend
	INNER JOIN Likes USING(ID1)
	WHERE Likes.ID2 = Friend.ID2
);

3.For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.)
